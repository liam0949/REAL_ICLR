# REAL: Reading out Transformer Activations for Precise Localization in Language Model Steering

> Official code repository for the ICLR 2026 paper: **"REAL: Reading out Transformer Activations for Precise Localization in Language Model Steering"**.

**REAL** is a novel inference-time activation engineering framework designed to precisely localize and steer behavior-relevant modules within Large Language Models (LLMs) without altering the model's weights. 

By leveraging a Vector-Quantized Autoencoder (VQ-AE), REAL partitions internal Transformer activations into behavior-relevant and behavior-irrelevant subspaces. This allows for highly accurate, parameter-free model steering to elicit targeted behaviors—such as factual accuracy, grounded specificity, and policy-aligned abstention—while preventing the catastrophic degradation often seen in standard steering methods.
